        <li>Combine hot pepper sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter is melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Transfer smoked wings to a large bowl; stir in 1/2 of the sauce until wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Grill coated wings until skin is browned and starting to get crispy, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining sauce until wings are well-coated.</li>
